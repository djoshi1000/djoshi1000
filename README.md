## 🔬 About Me

I am a geospatial scientist and applied researcher specializing in **remote sensing, geospatial AI, and large-scale environmental analytics**. My work focuses on transforming **satellite imagery, LiDAR, and spatiotemporal data** into actionable insights for **land-use/land-cover (LULC), flood risk, urban systems, and ecological monitoring**.

I currently work as a **Remote Sensing Analyst**, where I design **production-ready GeoAI pipelines** using Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 SAR, LiDAR, and machine-learning models deployed through **Google Earth Engine, Python, and GIS platforms**.

My background combines:
- Strong theoretical foundations
- Reproducible scientific workflows
- Real-world decision-support applications
