## 🔬 About Me

I am a geospatial scientist and applied researcher specializing in **remote sensing, geospatial AI, and applied deep learning**. My work focuses on transforming **satellite imagery, LiDAR, and spatiotemporal data** into actionable insights for **land-use/land-cover (LULC), flood risk, urban systems, and ecological monitoring**.

I also build **computer vision pipelines for dashcam video analytics**, including **near real-time object detection and geolocation** (video-to-map), enabling scalable mapping of features from street-level imagery and rapid situational awareness.

I currently work as a **Remote Sensing Analyst**, where I design **production-ready GeoAI pipelines** using Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1 SAR, LiDAR, and machine-learning/deep-learning models deployed through **Google Earth Engine, Python, and GIS platforms**.

My background combines:
- Strong theoretical foundations
- Reproducible scientific workflows
- Real-world decision-support applications
- Engineering discipline for scalable deployment

## 🚗 Dashcam Video Geolocation (Applied Deep Learning)

I develop **end-to-end pipelines** that convert dashcam video into **mappable geospatial intelligence**, including:
- Near real-time **object detection** and **instance segmentation**
- Robust **video tracking** and frame-to-frame consistency
- **Geolocation of detected objects** using camera geometry + GPS/IMU signals (when available)
- Export-ready outputs (GeoJSON/Shapefile-ready features, event logs, and QA layers)
- Scalable workflows for corridor-level monitoring and rapid mapping

Use cases include: roadside vegetation/asset monitoring, hazard reporting, and rapid feature inventory.
